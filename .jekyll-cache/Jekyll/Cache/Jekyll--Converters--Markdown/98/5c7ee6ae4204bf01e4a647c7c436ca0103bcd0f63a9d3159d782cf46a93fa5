<p>The SBU announcement specifies that “one of the Russian pseudo-hacking groups has taken responsibility for the attack.” This group is a part of the hacking division of the GRU, which publicly legitimizes the results of its criminal activities.</p>

<p>Cyber experts from the Security Service of Ukraine are currently actively collaborating with “Kyivstar” specialists to restore the network after yesterday’s hacker attack.</p>

<p>According to preliminary estimates, on December 13, the restoration of fixed internet for households is planned, along with the launch of mobile communication and the internet. However, the restoration of all services will take time due to critical damage to the digital infrastructure of “Kyivstar” inflicted during the attack.</p>

<p>The SBU continues to document Russia’s cyber attack as a war crime, drawing attention to the aggression against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure.</p>
