<h2 id="challenges-with-passwords">Challenges with Passwords</h2>

<p>Weak, reused, and compromised passwords were persistent challenges for both users and security personnel in 2016. Fast forward seven years, and little has changed; passwords remain a substantial security concern. Fortunately, numerous technologies that were emerging back then have now become mainstream, providing organizations with more choices and flexibility to eliminate passwords while still enhancing‚Äînot just maintaining‚Äîsecurity and user experience in many cases.</p>

<p>Although passwords can safeguard a user‚Äôs identity and personal data, achieving 100% security in today‚Äôs digitally interconnected world is an unattainable goal when online. Regrettably, the requirement for customers, business associates, frontline employees, and executives to remember and input increasingly complex passwords hampers the user experience. Furthermore, in terms of security, passwords persist as one of the weakest links.</p>

<h2 id="biometrics">Biometrics</h2>

<p>In 2016, a variety of contemporary authentication methods and technologies had surfaced, and many of them continue to be in use today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
Commencing in the early 2000s, the adoption of two-factor authentication became widespread. In this scenario, users receive a one-time code on their mobile phones, which they enter in addition to the traditional password displayed on their laptop screens. This added layer of security stems from the authentication occurring across multiple channels.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Biometrics
Around 2013, primarily driven by the popularity of the latest smartphone models, biometric authentication entered the mainstream. These technologies eliminate the need for memorizing complex combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols by leveraging distinct characteristics of the user‚Äîsuch as fingerprints, voice, face, heartbeat, and common movements. The most prevalent biometrics captured by smartphone cameras and voice recorders include fingerprint, iris, voice, and face recognition. These approaches fall under the umbrella of ‚Äúwhat you are‚Äù (see Figure 1). The preferred approach involves checking biometric data against a trusted device that the user owns, rather than a central repository. For instance, a user could scan their retina via the camera on a laptop or smartphone, utilizing biometric identification as the first step to access their online bank account. In a second step, the bank could then send a challenge via text message to the user‚Äôs mobile phone, requiring them to reply with a text message to complete the authentication process.</p>
