<p>Web applications frequently enable users to upload files for various purposes such as profile photos, avatars, photo sharing, animated GIFs in forums, layout customization, and file distribution (PDF, Word, Excel). However, potential abuses arise when users upload too many files, files that are excessively large, or files at a high frequency. Such actions can strain a system’s file storage resources, causing depletion. Additionally, users may inadvertently or intentionally upload files with the wrong content type, creating mismatches with the application’s expectations (e.g., uploading a movie instead of an image). These abuses, whether accidental or intentional, pose risks such as server slowdowns, connection monopolization, and potential denial of service.</p>

<p>The SBU announcement specifies that “one of the Russian pseudo-hacking groups has taken responsibility for the attack.” This group is a part of the hacking division of the GRU, which publicly legitimizes the results of its criminal activities.</p>

<p>Cyber experts from the Security Service of Ukraine are currently actively collaborating with “Kyivstar” specialists to restore the network after yesterday’s hacker attack.</p>

<p>According to preliminary estimates, on December 13, the restoration of fixed internet for households is planned, along with the launch of mobile communication and the internet. However, the restoration of all services will take time due to critical damage to the digital infrastructure of “Kyivstar” inflicted during the attack.</p>

<p>The SBU continues to document Russia’s cyber attack as a war crime, drawing attention to the aggression against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure.</p>
