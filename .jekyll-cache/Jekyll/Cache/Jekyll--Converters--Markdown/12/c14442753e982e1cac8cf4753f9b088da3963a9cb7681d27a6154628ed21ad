I"<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Remote Code Execution occurs when external code can execute internal operating-system-level commands on a server from a distance.</p>

<p>Once an attacker gains access to the internal OS-level, they can perform tasks equivalent to a logged-in user:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read, add, modify, delete files</li>
  <li>Change access privileges, passwords</li>
  <li>Turn on and off configurations and services</li>
  <li>Communicate with other servers</li>
</ul>

<p>While this is a potent attack, executing it is challenging. There is a division between the operating system and the software it runs, and casual access is not possible. However, there are access pathways as most programming languages have functions allowing direct communication with the underlying OS.</p>

<p>To achieve Remote Code Execution, two conditions must be met:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A programmer must use a function enabling communication with the OS.</li>
  <li>An attacker must find a way to input dynamic data into that function call.</li>
</ol>

<p>The SBU announcement specifies that “one of the Russian pseudo-hacking groups has taken responsibility for the attack.” This group is a part of the hacking division of the GRU, which publicly legitimizes the results of its criminal activities.</p>

<p>Cyber experts from the Security Service of Ukraine are currently actively collaborating with “Kyivstar” specialists to restore the network after yesterday’s hacker attack.</p>

<p>According to preliminary estimates, on December 13, the restoration of fixed internet for households is planned, along with the launch of mobile communication and the internet. However, the restoration of all services will take time due to critical damage to the digital infrastructure of “Kyivstar” inflicted during the attack.</p>

<p>The SBU continues to document Russia’s cyber attack as a war crime, drawing attention to the aggression against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure.</p>
