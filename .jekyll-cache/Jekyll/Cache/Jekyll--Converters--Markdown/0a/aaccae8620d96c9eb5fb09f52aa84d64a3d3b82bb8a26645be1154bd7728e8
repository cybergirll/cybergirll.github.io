<p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) arises when code incorporates user-supplied data into the response without adequately sanitizing it beforehand. Named for the capability it grants attackers to execute JavaScript on someone else’s site, Cross-Site Scripting is commonly referred to as “XSS.”</p>

<p>This vulnerability holds the #3 position on OWASP’s list of Top 10 security threats and stands out as the most prevalent flaw in web application security.</p>

<p>Various methods enable hackers to inject JavaScript into a page, contingent on the output of unsanitized incoming data. Once the hacker successfully embeds their JavaScript within the page response, the script executes, typically unbeknownst to the unsuspecting user. The script can carry out a range of actions, including pilfering site cookies or session data. This exploit works because the browser inherently trusts all JavaScript provided with the page.</p>
