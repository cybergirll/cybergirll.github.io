<p>Web applications frequently enable users to upload files for various purposes such as profile photos, avatars, photo sharing, animated GIFs in forums, layout customization, and file distribution (PDF, Word, Excel). However, potential abuses arise when users upload too many files, files that are excessively large, or files at a high frequency. Such actions can strain a system‚Äôs file storage resources, causing depletion. Additionally, users may inadvertently or intentionally upload files with the wrong content type, creating mismatches with the application‚Äôs expectations (e.g., uploading a movie instead of an image). These abuses, whether accidental or intentional, pose risks such as server slowdowns, connection monopolization, and potential denial of service.</p>
